# TodayILearned
Since I am stumbled a few blogs where the author has a list of TIL in their blog where they take notes or snippets on things that they learn on the day.  

I felt this is a good practise to retain and refresh all the gained knowledge. I am using GitHub repository to store all the notes in MarkDown as it is easy to be converted to documents or PDF.

In this repository, each folder is consider as a category and within the folder, there are notes for the category.
