# Deleting Words in Vim
------------------------

1. Use `dw` to **delete word**. Cursor placement is important! If your cursor is not on the first character, it will only delete from your cursor to the end of the word.
2. Use `diw` to **delete inside word**. Deletes the entire word that your cursor resides in.
3. Use `dt<char>` to delete to character. Deletes from your cursor to the specified character.
